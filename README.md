I dabbled in learning to code in the past but now I am found a passion for front-end web development and I have not been able to stop since I started. I did a month of html and css through codecademy back in may and since the end of may since I join Central Washington University bootcamp offered through Promineo Tech I have been studying just javaScript and how to use node.js. Soon we will be learning bootstrap and react I hoping to learn more about the ins and outs of coding now that I found a goal. I will build my skills in the next couple of months to and my goals are to improve my code by working on projects since I heard that is the best way to work. My goals after the bootcamp is to go back and finish my degree and look for internships so that by the time I am done I wil be well equiped to do my best work.
