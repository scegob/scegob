I am a frontend bootcamp grad from Central Washington University partnered with Promineo Tech I have been studying javaScript, node.js, html, css,bootstrap and react I hoping to learn more about the ins and outs of coding. Promineo Tech taught us the skills necessary to be a high impact employee at a tech company.

Currently writing on medium about tech and web development.
