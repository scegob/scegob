I am a student at the University of Washington Bothell. I have found a passion for front-end web development and I have not been able to stop since I started. I did a month of html and css through codecademy back in may and since the end of may since 
I am a frontend bootcamp grad from Central Washington University partnered with Promineo Tech I have been studying just javaScript, node.js, html, css,bootstrap and react I hoping to learn more about the ins and outs of coding. Promineo Tech taught us the skills necessary to be a high impact employee at a tech company. I am a Frontend Development Intern at Chosn Relationships a startup focusing on building a mental health application to build better relationships with family and friends.
